-- Apply is a subclass of Functor which implements an additional

-- A superclass is usually a less specific specification of behaviours
-- For instance - a monoid is a subclass of a semigroup becuase a monoid 
-- Is first a `Semigroup` with but with an additional Identity element

-- Relationship bewteen map and apply
-- Given that a function with multiple arguments is supplied to map
-- where map is defined as map :: f -> a -> fa
-- A function with two arguments must be curried such that
-- the following function f(x, y) -> z is x -> (y -> z) 
-- when this function is applied by map to a functor
-- we have a new data structure of functions waiting to be evaluated 
-- to the simplest irreducible form. 
-- the function apply from typeclass `Apply` can traverse this functor
-- and squeeze out an irreducible expression or value as the case may be.
-- Hence, the expression 
-- apply (map g x) y === g <$> x <*> y where <$> is map & <*> is apply

-- map -> wrap into context
-- apply -> operate on primitives within context
-- pure -> back into context
